REACT NATIVE CHALLENGE: Create a form

User Stories:
* Weight (numeric keyboard input)
* Height (numeric keyboard input)
* Unit Selection => picker with “imperial” and “metric”
* Unit default => Imperial.

Imperial units:
* weight => lbs
* height => feet and inches.

Metric units:
* weight => kilograms
* height => meter

Unit labels:
* lbs, ft, kg, m
* Rendered right of the corresponding input fields

On change:
* height and weight values should be recalculated and the unit labels should be updated

Save Button:
* located at bottom
* stores the data as a JSON file on disk 
* load previously saved data on re-launch
* values should populate in the input fields of the form.

Notes on Implementation:
1. React Native, TypeScript, React hooks
2. a state management solution like redux or simply useReducer. 
3. The code should be well-typed and not use `any` or `unknown` types.
4. Please implement unit tests

Notes on Unit Tests:
1. verify the form renders correctly
2. changing the units properly recalculates the height and weight values.
